### 8-Puzzle Solver

This project implements a solver for the classic **8-puzzle** problem using multiple search algorithms:

-  Breadth-First Search (BFS)
-  Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)
-  Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
-  A* Search

The program receives a scrambled 3x3 tile configuration (digits 0â€“8) and searches for a solution path to one of two predefined goal states.

It also prints:
- Number of developed nodes
- Step-by-step solution (when found)
- Efficiency summary of all algorithms
